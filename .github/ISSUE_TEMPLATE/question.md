## Questions & Discussion
To cut down on long-standing topics that are discussion-based, rather than actual issues, please opt for one of the following paths, when possible.  These have the benefit of potentially helping others after the issue (here) would have been closed.
1. [Create a Discussion Topic](https://github.com/kwhitley/itty-router/discussions/new/choose)
2. [Discuss on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/832353585802903572)

Cheers!
